        Make sure to add one business day to allow for processing when you place
        your order, in addition to the time it takes for the order to get to you
        once it has shipped. This time is usually about 5-10 business days
        within the EU but is often faster. This is different from country to
        country. 95% of our EU shipments arrives within a week after receiving
        your payment.
        <br /> <br />
        International shipments within the EU have usually no problems getting
        through customs. Shipping outside the EU can take a little bit longer
        due to customs but are most of the times processed quickly.
